# Memory-Game
Memory game assignment from Springboard
This is a simple memory game I made in one of my Springboard Software Engineering bootcamp classes.  
The object for the player is to flip the cards to get matching pairs with the least number of tries.  
The object for me as a programmer was for me to practice my skills using localStorage and vanilla JS.
